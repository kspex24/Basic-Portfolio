      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/IMG_1030.JPG" alt="My picture">

        <p>Although, I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, I grew up in Brussels, Belgium.  Living overseas was a fantastic experience.  I really enjoyed meeting people from different countries and experiencing different cultures. I returned to the US for college and attended LSU where I majored in French.  After teaching for a short while, I attended paralegal school and worked in the legal department of the EPA. From there, I moved to a small software company called QWIZ, where I worked as a developer on their French language products.  Then, I moved back to the legal field working as a paralegal.</p>
        <p>After several years of working as a paralegal, I have decided to make a career change.  I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at Georgia Tech.  I hope to embark on a new and exciting career in Web Development in the near future.</p>
